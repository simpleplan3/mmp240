    <h1>Bean soup</h1>
    <p>When it comes to easy, cozy, and budget-friendly meals, this 15 Bean Soup recipe is a forever favorite. A little smoky and surprisingly complex, it’s begging to be served with a hunk of crusty bread and big shavings of Parmesan.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>15 Bean Soup Mix. Look for anything called “bean soup mix.” S
            While the exact beans will vary from brand to brand, 15 bean soup typically contains some mix of navy beans, black beans, red beans, pinto beans, chickpeas, Great Northern beans (or white beans), kidney beans, baby lima and large lima beans. Black-eyed, yellow split peas, and green split peas can also be used.

        <li>Bacon. Bacon adds to the soup’s rich, hearty flavor, and the drippings are perfect for sautéing the other ingredients. (</li>
        <li>Vegetables. For added flavor and nutritional value. I chose to add the golden soup trifecta of onion, carrots, and celery </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
